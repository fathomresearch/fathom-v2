## The Problem

NASCAR didn’t need another readout on fan satisfaction.

They needed clarity on what truly drives fan passion—and how to stand apart in an increasingly crowded entertainment landscape.

The expected route?

Run surveys. Host focus groups. Ask fans what they like. Chart the data. Deliver the findings.

That approach would document preferences.

It wouldn’t redefine the problem.

Because the real question wasn’t *what do fans enjoy?*

It was *what is NASCAR actually giving them that nothing else can?*

## The Solution

We shifted the frame.

Through ethnographic research with NASCAR fans across the country, we focused less on stated opinions and more on lived experience. Not what they say. What they feel. Not surface attributes. Emotional truth.

The insight reframed the category:

NASCAR isn’t just entertainment. It’s one of the last places people experience something raw and real.

That reframe became **“Hell Yeah”**—a campaign built around the exhilaration and pride fans feel across the nation.

The research didn’t validate assumptions.

It redefined the value of NASCAR itself.
