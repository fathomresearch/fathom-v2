## The Problem

NASCAR needed to understand what truly drives fan passion and differentiate their sport in an increasingly crowded entertainment landscape.

The standard approach would be surveys and focus groups. Ask fans what they like. Chart the data. Deliver the findings.

But that would miss what really matters.

## The Solution

We went deeper. Ethnographic research with NASCAR fans across the country. Not what they think. What they feel. Not surface preferences. Core emotional truth.

The insight: NASCAR isn't just entertainment. It's the rarest place on earth to feel something raw and real.

This became 'Hell Yeah'—a campaign amplifying the exhilaration and pride fans feel across the nation.

**The best research doesn't confirm what you already know. It reframes how you see the entire category.**
