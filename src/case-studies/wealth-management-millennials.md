## The Problem

Every strategy team has a theory about their customer. A wealth management firm had a theory about Millennials: too young, not wealthy enough, not ready for the brand. The kind of assumption that gets repeated in enough meetings that it stops feeling like a theory and starts feeling like a fact.

Nobody had stopped long enough to ask it the right questions. And the last time they tried, it took 12 weeks and arrived after the decision was already made.
They didn't need another study, but rather, clarity before the next conversation with leadership.

## The Solution

We spent a weekend collecting first-party data and digging into Millennial wealth patterns. What we found wasn't a confirmation of the hunch or a flat-out contradiction. We found *nuance.* 

Millennials weren't closed off to the brand. If anything, they were more open than the team gave them credit for, actively looking for exactly the kind of expertise the firm had spent years building. The gap wasn't the product. It wasn't the price point. It was that nobody had made the case that this brand was built for them.
This wasn't a segment to revisit in three years. It was an opportunity they were already sitting on.

The best insights don't just confirm what you suspected. They show you what you were too close to see. And when you can get there in a weekend instead of a quarter, you actually have time to do something with what you learned.
