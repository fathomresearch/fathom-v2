## The Problem

A wealth management firm had theories about Millennials.

Too young. Not wealthy enough yet. Not the right fit for the brand.

The data suggested otherwise, but the assumptions were sticky.

They needed clarity fast. Not a 12-week study. A weekend.

## The Solution

We dug into Millennial wealth patterns and uncovered something unexpected: they weren't closed off to the brand. They were more open than expected, seeking exactly the kind of expertise the firm offered.

The segment wasn't a future play. It was a current opportunity being left on the table.

**The best insights add nuance you didn't see coming. They challenge assumptions you didn't know you were making. And when you can get them in a weekend instead of a quarter, you actually have time to act on what you learn.**

Perfect answers take too long. Useful ones get used.
