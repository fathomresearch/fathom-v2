## The Problem

A major sportsbook spent months segmenting U.S. sports bettors. Three distinct audiences. Deep insights into values, needs, motivations. Then the creative brief changed.

Traditional research says: "We can field another study. Six weeks, if we move fast." 

The timeline says: "We pitch next week." 

Your gut says: "Segment 2 will hate this angle, I can't walk into that room and defend it with a hunch.”

## The Solution

We turned their segmentation data into a synthetic panel built from real customer responses that the team could interrogate whenever the questions changed.

Need to test new messaging against all three segments tonight? Ask them. Want to explore how Segment 2 reacts to a positioning shift? Have the conversation. Creative team lands on a wild idea at 9pm? Validate it before the morning meeting.

The research they already paid for didn't stop working when the deck got filed away. It became a tool the strategy team could pressure-test ideas against, on their timeline.

It’s strategy at the speed of insight. Backed by data, not just vibes and caffeine.
