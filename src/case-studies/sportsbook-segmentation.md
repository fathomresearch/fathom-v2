## The Problem

A major sportsbook spent months segmenting U.S. sports bettors. Three distinct audiences. Deep insights into values, needs, motivations.

Then the creative brief changed.

Traditional research says: "Let's field another study."

The timeline says: "We pitch next week."

Your gut says: "Segment 2 will hate this angle, but I can't prove it."

## The Solution

We turned their segmentation data into a synthetic panel they could interrogate directly.

Need to test new messaging against all three segments? Ask them.

Want to explore objections to a positioning shift? Have the conversation.

Creative team has a wild idea at 9pm? Validate it before morning.
